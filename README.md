# Masterworker
A Diablo 4 script that automatically masterworks your items until it gets 3x CRIT on the chosen affix.

> [!WARNING]  
> Keep in mind that using any kind of 3rd party tools can get you banned.
> **Use at your own risk.**

## Usage
- Download all the necessary files.
- Ensure Diablo 4 is running and in focus.
- To select an affix, navigate to the resources folder and replace the affix.png image with an image of the affix you want to masterwork (set to cooldown reduction by default).
- After everything is set up - Run the program, switch to the game window, and press the ` key to start.
- Program will stop automatically when the item is fully masterworked, or if there aren't enough materials to continue. You can also stop it manually by pressing the ` button again, or by changing the active window.
- You can see the attempt number, as well as successes and fails in the terminal.
